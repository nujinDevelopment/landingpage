# Getting Started Guide

## Installation

Nope. No installation needed.

## Make changes

I will assume that you already know the basic of nuxt.js. If not, you can check out their [documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).

Now that it's yours, you can make changes to it. Be creative you can start by removing the contents in the `pages/index.vue`. Feel free to utilize the `GenericPanel.vue` component as it adds a nice balance to the layout.

## Preview

You can preview your build by running the `nuxt start` command.

```bash
# Preview your build
$ nuxt start
```

## Build

You can choose to build it using the defaul strategy which is SSR, but you also have the option to generate static files so you can just upload your work in any static hosting service. The sample site of this repo is hosted in Vercel.


```bash
# Build for production using SSR
$ nuxt build
```

```bash
# Build for production and generate static files
$ nuxt generate
```
